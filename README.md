# Add to OBS

## Command Tools
Then as a last step, add a Browser source in OBS:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17751686/129710382-8d28db74-6533-483c-9a7f-4137b4b3692e.png)

Check the "Local File" box, then go to where you've unzipped the app and choose the `myCommandTool.html` file as a source.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17751686/129711175-ba27df2a-8463-4950-9f2c-0e532b062b95.png)

Don't forget to check the `Shutdown source when not visible` box or the app will still function when you change scenes and you'll get duplicate sounds/videos/bot commands.

## Chat Box
A light chat box is also available for use by adding the file `myChatBox.html` as a source the same way as the commands.
